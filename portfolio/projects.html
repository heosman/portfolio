<h3>About my Client</h3>
<p>My client was a watercolor and gouache painter. As an artist, she wanted to be able to share her art with the world. Making a website was one way to showcase her art and open a window of new opportunities. </p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>The first step was discussing the client's needs and preferences for her website. Her needs and preference included the following:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li> A interactive gallery that would provide the viewers with an aesthetically pleasing experience viewing her art</li>
    <li> A simple minimalist appearance and a responsive layout that would look good and function properly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.</li>
    <li> A way to contact her with any questions</li>
    <li> A way to submit commissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Next was deciding the structure of her website on desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions. I used wireframe diagrams to visualize this.</p>
<p>As the resolution reduced, I altered the sizes of the elements to accommodate the difference in size. On the resolution of a phone, I switched the navigation bar to be a drop down menu, which provided ease in navigation for smaller devices.</p>
<p class="link">I created her website using HTML and CSS. At the time, I was a student, so there were some tools I used that accomplished what I needed to. I used <a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" target="_blank">Lightbox</a> to create the interactive image gallery. I also used ReCaptcha as an extra validation step in the forms for the contact pag and commission pages. </p>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>The result was an artsy and aesthetically pleasing website with an interactive gallery and functional forms for commissions and contact. Despite the fact that my client isn't currently hosting her website, the most important part is that my client was pleased. </p>
